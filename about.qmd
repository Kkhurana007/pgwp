title: "Why We’re Protesting?"
---


Canada has long promoted itself as a land of opportunity for international students, with slogans like "Study, Work, and Stay" on government websites. However, behind these promises lies a system ripe for exploitation. Canadian colleges, in partnership with unscrupulous agents, offered high commissions to recruit students under false pretenses. Many of us were funneled into low-quality courses like tourism and business, with promises of good jobs and pathways to permanent residency—promises that remain largely unfulfilled.


# Why We Need Your Support?

Many of us have left our jobs to maintain this 24/7 protest. We are committed to staying until our voices are heard and our demands are met, but we need community support to continue this fight. Funds raised will go towards:

Langar (community meals) to ensure no protester goes hungry.
Support for students who have sacrificed their livelihoods to participate in the encampment.
This movement goes beyond just international students. It’s about fighting for fair treatment, ethical policies, and ending exploitation. We stand for justice, and with your support, we can continue this fight until real change is achieved.

Please contribute what you can and share this campaign with others. Together, we can create a fairer future for all international students in Canada.
