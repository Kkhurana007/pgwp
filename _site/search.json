    "text": "Support International Students Fighting for Justice\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a group of international students protesting 24/7 in an encampment, standing against the exploitation we‚Äôve experienced in Canada. Lured by promises of a bright future, we paid exorbitant tuition fees to colleges that turned out to be nothing more than diploma mills. Many of these institutions, now shut down by the government, made millions over seven years, leaving us with poor-quality education, overwhelming debt, and a sense of betrayal. The damage was done long before authorities intervened.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, countries like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Ireland signed the London Statement, designed to protect students from exploitation by agents. Canada, however, chose not to sign this statement, allowing unethical recruitment practices to thrive.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been caught in a system that enriches colleges while leaving international students in dire situations. With no immigration draws for two years (2022 & 2023) and policies like upper caps limiting access to Provincial Nomination Programs, our chances for fair opportunities have all but vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your support üôè"

    "text": "Canada has long promoted itself as a land of opportunity for international students, with slogans like ‚ÄúStudy, Work, and Stay‚Äù on government websites. However, behind these promises lies a system ripe for exploitation. Canadian colleges, in partnership with unscrupulous agents, offered high commissions to recruit students under false pretenses. Many of us were funneled into low-quality courses like tourism and business, with promises of good jobs and pathways to permanent residency‚Äîpromises that remain largely unfulfilled.\n\nWhy We Need Your Support?\nMany of us have left our jobs to maintain this 24/7 protest. We are committed to staying until our voices are heard and our demands are met, but we need community support to continue this fight. Funds raised will go towards:\nLangar (community meals) to ensure no protester goes hungry. Support for students who have sacrificed their livelihoods to participate in the encampment. This movement goes beyond just international students. It‚Äôs about fighting for fair treatment, ethical policies, and ending exploitation. We stand for justice, and with your support, we can continue this fight until real change is achieved.\nPlease contribute what you can and share this campaign with others. Together, we can create a fairer future for all international students in Canada."
