We are a group of international students protesting 24/7 in an encampment, standing against the exploitation we‚Äôve experienced in Canada. Lured by promises of a bright future, we paid exorbitant tuition fees to colleges that turned out to be nothing more than diploma mills. Many of these institutions, now shut down by the government, made millions over seven years, leaving us with poor-quality education, overwhelming debt, and a sense of betrayal. The damage was done long before authorities intervened.

In 2012, countries like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Ireland signed the London Statement, designed to protect students from exploitation by agents. Canada, however, chose not to sign this statement, allowing unethical recruitment practices to thrive.

We have been caught in a system that enriches colleges while leaving international students in dire situations. With no immigration draws for two years (2022 & 2023) and policies like upper caps limiting access to Provincial Nomination Programs, our chances for fair opportunities have all but vanished.
