Help support the PGWP Workersâ€™ Protest! International students in Canada are facing unfair treatment, broken promises, and exploitation. We are protesting for justice, demanding fair immigration pathways, work permit extensions, and an end to unethical labor practices. Many protesters have left their jobs to fight for these rights, and we need your help to continue this movement. Your donations will fund essential protest needs like food, supplies, and outreach efforts. Together, we can create real change for international students seeking a fair chance at success. Please contribute and help us keep the protest going!
